# Unit 4 Homwork

For this weeks homework I was given the task of creating a quiz about coding using HTML, CSS and Javascript while starting from scratch.

The objectives to complete this homework include the following:
* A working start button that begins the quiz and cannot be clicked during it
* When the quiz begins a timer starts to countdown
* After answering a question another question is presented
* If the answer is incorrect then time is subtracted
* When the quiz is finished or the time runs out then the game is over
* Initials are recorded along with score
